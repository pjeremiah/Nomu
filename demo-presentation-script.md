### **Scenario 1: Normal Customer Operations (2 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "First, let me demonstrate normal customer behavior. A customer opens their mobile app and scans a QR code to earn loyalty points."

**What to do:**
1. Run the normal scanning scenario
2. Show successful responses
3. Highlight rate limit headers
4. Point out points accumulation

**Key messages:**
- "Notice the smooth user experience"
- "Rate limit headers show remaining requests"
- "Points are awarded correctly"

### **Scenario 2: Daily Scan Limit Enforcement (2 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "Now let's see what happens when a customer tries to abuse the system by scanning too many times per day. Our system enforces a 10 scans per day limit."

**What to do:**
1. Run the daily limit scenario
2. Show first 10 scans succeeding
3. Show subsequent scans being blocked
4. Highlight clear error messages

**Key messages:**
- "First 10 scans succeed normally"
- "After 10 scans, the system blocks further attempts"
- "Clear error messages inform the user"

### **Scenario 3: Daily Points Limit Enforcement (2 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "We also protect against points abuse with a 50 points per day limit. Let me show you this protection in action."

**What to do:**
1. Run the points limit scenario
2. Show points accumulating
3. Show blocking when limit reached
4. Display total points earned

**Key messages:**
- "Points accumulate normally up to the limit"
- "System prevents excessive point earning"
- "Fair usage is enforced automatically"

### **Scenario 4: IP Rate Limiting (1.5 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "Our system also protects against DDoS attacks with IP-based rate limiting. Let me demonstrate this protection."

**What to do:**
1. Run the IP rate limiting scenario
2. Show first 100 requests succeeding
3. Show subsequent requests being blocked
4. Highlight HTTP 429 responses

**Key messages:**
- "First 100 requests per 15 minutes succeed"
- "Additional requests are blocked with HTTP 429"
- "Server remains responsive for legitimate users"

## 👨‍💼 **Part 2: Mobile Barista Security Demo (8 minutes)**

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**
> "Now let's look at the barista mobile app. This is where we prevent employee abuse and ensure fair usage across all baristas."

### **Scenario 1: Normal Barista Operations (2 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "First, let me show normal barista operations. A barista logs in and scans customer QR codes to process orders and award points."

**What to do:**
1. Run the normal barista scenario
2. Show successful customer scans
3. Highlight employee rate tracking
4. Display success responses

**Key messages:**
- "Baristas can scan customer QR codes normally"
- "System tracks hourly and daily limits"
- "Customer data is processed correctly"

### **Scenario 2: Rapid-Fire Scanning Detection (2.5 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "Now let's see our abuse detection in action. I'll simulate a barista trying to scan too rapidly, which could indicate abuse or system malfunction."

**What to do:**
1. Run the rapid-fire scenario
2. Show rapid scanning attempts
3. Highlight abuse detection alerts in console
4. Show blocking with clear error messages

**Key messages:**
- "System detects rapid-fire scanning patterns"
- "Abuse detection alerts appear in real-time"
- "Suspicious activity is blocked automatically"

### **Scenario 3: Same Customer Abuse Detection (2 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "We also detect when a barista scans the same customer repeatedly, which could indicate collusion or system abuse."

**What to do:**
1. Run the same customer scenario
2. Show repeated scans of same customer
3. Highlight abuse detection in console
4. Show blocking after threshold

**Key messages:**
- "System tracks customer scan patterns"
- "Repeated scans of same customer trigger alerts"
- "Abuse is prevented before it escalates"

### **Scenario 4: Advanced Security Features (1.5 minutes)**

**What to say:**
> "Finally, let me show our advanced security features including JWT tokens, security headers, and real-time monitoring."

**What to do:**
1. Show security headers demonstration
2. Display JWT token generation and validation
3. Highlight CORS protection
4. Show real-time monitoring logs

**Key messages:**
- "JWT tokens provide secure authentication"
- "Security headers protect against common attacks"
- "Real-time monitoring provides visibility"
