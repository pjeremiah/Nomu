## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Quick Fixes**

### **Common Issues**
- [ ] **Server won't start**: Check ports, kill existing processes
- [ ] **MongoDB connection failed**: Start MongoDB, check connection string
- [ ] **Demo scripts fail**: Check server health, verify API endpoints
- [ ] **Rate limiting not working**: Check environment variables, middleware order

### **Quick Commands**
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
netstat -an | findstr :5000
netstat -an | findstr :5002

# Kill processes using ports
taskkill /F /PID <process_id>

# Check MongoDB
mongosh --eval "db.runCommand('ping')"

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl http://localhost:5002/api/health
```
