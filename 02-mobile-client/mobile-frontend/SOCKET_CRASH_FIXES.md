# Socket Crash Fixes - NOMU Mobile App

## Problem Analysis

The socket crashes in your Flutter app were caused by several critical issues:

### 1. **StreamController Memory Leaks**
- StreamControllers were being closed without checking if they were already closed
- This caused "StreamController is closed" errors when trying to add data
- Multiple components were trying to access the same closed controllers

### 2. **Multiple Socket Initialization**
- Both `homepage.dart` and `loyalty_page.dart` were initializing sockets simultaneously
- This created race conditions and duplicate connections
- No proper cleanup of existing connections before creating new ones

### 3. **Auto-Reconnect Timer Leaks**
- Reconnect timers were never properly cancelled
- Multiple timers could run simultaneously
- Memory leaks from uncancelled timers

### 4. **Missing Error Boundaries**
- Socket event handlers had no try-catch blocks
- Errors in event processing could crash the entire socket connection
- No graceful recovery from connection errors

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed StreamController Lifecycle Management**
```dart
// Before: Dangerous - could close already closed controllers
_loyaltyPointController.close();

// After: Safe - check if closed first
if (!_loyaltyPointController.isClosed) {
  _loyaltyPointController.close();
}
```

### 2. **Improved Socket Initialization**
```dart
// Before: Always tried to initialize
await _socketService.initialize();

// After: Only initialize if not already initialized
if (!currentStatus['isInitialized']) {
  await _socketService.initialize();
}
```

### 3. **Fixed Auto-Reconnect Timer Management**
```dart
// Added proper timer cancellation
Timer? _reconnectTimer;

void _startAutoReconnect() {
  _reconnectTimer?.cancel(); // Cancel existing timer
  _reconnectTimer = Timer.periodic(...);
}
```

### 4. **Added Comprehensive Error Handling**
```dart
// Wrapped all socket event handlers in try-catch
_socket!.on('loyalty-point-added', (data) {
  try {
    // Event handling code
  } catch (e) {
    LoggingService.instance.error('Error handling event', e);
  }
});
```

### 5. **Enhanced Connection Monitoring**
- Added proper disconnect reason logging
- Improved reconnection logic
- Better connection status tracking

## Key Improvements

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: All StreamControllers are now properly managed
2. **Race Condition Prevention**: Only one socket initialization at a time
3. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of connection errors
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of timers and connections
5. **Better Logging**: Enhanced debugging information
6. **No Auto-Reconnect**: Removed automatic reconnection to prevent unwanted disconnections
7. **Stable Connection**: Socket will only connect once and stay connected until manually disconnected

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Multiple Page Navigation**: Navigate between homepage and loyalty page multiple times
2. **Test Network Interruption**: Turn off/on network while app is running (socket will disconnect but not reconnect)
3. **Test Background/Foreground**: Put app in background and bring back
4. **Test Long Sessions**: Keep app running for extended periods
5. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks in long-running sessions
6. **Test Manual Reconnection**: Use the new `reconnect()` method if needed

## Manual Reconnection

If the socket disconnects and you need to reconnect, you can now use:
```dart
bool success = await SocketService.instance.reconnect();
```

The socket will no longer automatically reconnect, giving you full control over the connection lifecycle.

## Monitoring

The fixes include enhanced logging that will help you monitor:
- Socket connection status
- Reconnection attempts
- Error occurrences
- Stream controller states

Check your logs for messages prefixed with `[SOCKET]` to monitor socket health.

## Backend Considerations

Make sure your backend socket server is also robust:
- Handle client disconnections gracefully
- Implement proper error handling
- Add connection monitoring
- Consider rate limiting for reconnection attempts

The socket crashes should now be resolved with these comprehensive fixes!
